## Known Bugs and Limitations

### 1. **Responsiveness Issues**
   - Some pages (e.g., profile, checkout) have layout problems on smaller screens (mobile/tablet).
   - **Temporary Fix**: No workaround available yet. Being addressed in future updates.

### 2. **CSS Styling Inconsistencies**
   - Certain styles (e.g., buttons, fonts) may not render correctly across all browsers and devices.
   - **Temporary Fix**: Best viewed on Chrome; other browsers may have display issues.

### 3. **Content Overlap on Small Screens**
   - Text and images might overlap or not wrap correctly on smaller devices.
   - **Temporary Fix**: Resize the browser or use the desktop version on mobile.

### 4. **Font Size Inconsistencies**
   - Fonts may be too large or small depending on screen size.
   - **Temporary Fix**: Currently investigating better responsive typography.

### 5. **Advanced Product Search and Filters**
   - The current product search and filter functionality is not working as expected. While the basic search feature is in place, the advanced filters (such as price range, category, rating, and brand) are either not returning accurate results or are not functioning properly in certain cases.
   - **Possible Causes**: 
     - Incorrect form handling or missing query parameters in the backend.
     - Frontend elements (filters) may not be properly linked to the product listing or may not trigger the search functionality correctly.
     - JavaScript or AJAX issues causing filters to not update the displayed results dynamically.
   - **Next Steps**: Investigating the backend query logic, ensuring proper AJAX handling, and validating the UI interactions for accurate filtering.
